### Modularization
- breaking the big problem statement into smaller systems or modules
- breaking down the complex systems into smaller, self contained systems/modules
- Each module is
	- developed
	- maintained
	- tested separately
- Goal of modularization
	- Enhance the overall efficiency
	- Flexibility
	- Scalability
- Benefits
	- Parallelization
		- different teams can work on different components simultaneously
	- Reduce complexity
	- Reusability
	- Code maintenance
	- Easy troubleshooting
		- identity issues
		- fix problems
		- does not impact the entire system
	- Reduces
		- inter-dependence 
		- centralized points of failures
		- bottlenecks
	- Enhanced scalability
	- Enhanced stability
	- standardized stability
	- Better abstraction between modules
	- saves time to develop, debug, test and deploy

- Prioritizes
	- efficiency
		- easy to scale
		- stable
		- re-use
	- agility
		- changed
		- upgraded
		- downgraded
		- enhanced
	- flexibility
		- easily swap
		- replace

- Highly modular system enhances productivity significantly

Monolith can be converted into modular architecure
