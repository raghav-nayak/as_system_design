### Low Level Design(LLD)
- Execution heavy
	- writing code
	- maintaining services
- talks about the exact tech
- less abstraction
- e.g. algorithms used by load balancer or proxy server
- micro view of the system
- DSA, schema design are integral part
- Designing APIs and JSON are common
- Detailed plan from higher level plan
- contains
	- feature design
	- impact analysis
	- pseudo code
	- interface specification
	- design consideration

### High level Design(HLD)
- planning heaving
	- roadmap
	- technical direction
- high level tech components only
- higher level abstraction
- e.g. load balancer, proxy server, cache
- overall architecture
- macro view of the system
- No DSA, no schema design
- No need for API design, JSON design
- Blueprint from reqs
- Contains
	- System and solution architecture
	- use cases
	- data flow
	- interfaces
